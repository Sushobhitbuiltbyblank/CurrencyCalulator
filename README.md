# Things cover

UI is designed with UIKit Framework only. 
UI view to select the currency
UI for enter the currency
UI to get the converted value 
Architecture  - User Viper - I know this small project we can also use mvvm but I use because i want to show you that I have understanding of VIPER Architecture as well.
Coding Language - Swift 
Use Storyboard for UI. 
Use Core Data to store Response locally.



# Thinks I assume  

I assume that user have internet to run the app ist time. not test the internet connection as it is not the part of test if you want i will add that code as well.

The app only suppport conversion from dollar to the currency in the given list by the api.  As this api free and not allow me to get the list of currency rate if i select jpy for instance. so I make it static if you want to me to change that behaviour then for that  please, I need paid version or please allow me to use other api for this.

When converting, floating-point error is accpetable - i am not check this error as well

I also not write the unit test case if required please let me know. 

If any of the above issue effect my chance to select please let me know. 




# Thinks i am not use for now

I am learning UISwift as well but not use this time for time limit.
I can user mvvm for small project like time but prefer to show that I can have good understanding of VIPER as well.
